# Project_TRBG_Game
Torabaga Studios first game
The plan is:
### 1. Define Your Game Idea
#### Start Small: 
Begin with a simple concept, especially if you're new to game development. For example, a 2D platformer, puzzle game, or basic shooter.
#### Core Concept:
What is the main idea or mechanic of your game? (e.g., "A puzzle game where players manipulate gravity.")
#### Target Audience:
Who will play your game? Casual gamers, kids, or hardcore players?
#### Genre:
Decide on the type of game (e.g., RPG, platformer, simulation, etc.).

### 2. Plan Your Game
#### Write a Game Design Document (GDD):
This is a blueprint for your game. Include:
    - Story or theme (if applicable).
    - Gameplay mechanics (e.g., controls, objectives, challenges).
    - Art style (2D, 3D, pixel art, etc.).
    - Sound and music ideas. 
Scope: Keep the project small and achievable, especially if you're a beginner.

### 3. Choose Your Abilities
#### Game Engine:
Select an engine based on your skills and game type:
  - Unity: Great for 2D and 3D games, beginner-friendly with lots of tutorials.
  - Unreal Engine: Ideal for high-quality 3D games, but has a steeper learning curve.
  - Godot: Lightweight, open-source, and beginner-friendly for 2D and 3D games.
  - RPG Maker: Perfect for creating RPGs with minimal coding.
#### Art Abilities:
  - 2D Art: Use abilities like Photoshop, GIMP, or Aseprite (for pixel art).
  - 3D Art: Blender is a free and powerful ability for 3D modeling.
#### Sound Abilities:
  - Use abilities like Audacity for sound editing or find free sound effects/music on platforms like Freesound or OpenGameArt.
### 4. Learn the Basics
#### Programming: Learn the language used by your chosen engine:
  - Unity: C#
  - Unreal Engine: C++ or Blueprints (visual scripting)
  - Godot: GDScript (similar to Python)
#### Game Design Principles:
  - Study concepts like level design, player feedback, and balancing.
#### Art and Animation: 
  -Learn basic skills for creating or sourcing assets.
